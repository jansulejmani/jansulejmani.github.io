      <h2>1-Planar Storyplans</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Abstract:</strong> The ﬁeld of dynamic graph visualization has
        received a lot of attention in recent years as new use cases for the
        exploration of complex graphs have emerged. For example, the
        representation of vast amounts of relational data as graphs have made a
        visual analysis more challenging. Storyplans have been introduced as a
        tool for representing such graphs in a sequential and understandable
        manner. While planar storyplans as well as outerplanar and forest
        storyplans have been studied, there has been no research that has gone
        into the direction of more powerful storyplans such as 1-planar
        storyplans. This thesis explores the construction of 1-planar storyplans
        and delves into the speciﬁc graph classes that admit these kinds of
        storyplans. We will extend the strict containment of graph classes that
        admit storyplans established by Fiala, Firman, Liotta, Wolff, and Zink
        (SOFSEM 2024) as we explore graphs that do admit 1-planar storyplans but
        fail to do so for planar storyplans as well as graphs that do not admit
        1-planar storyplans. Furthermore, we generalize this graph containment
        for the graphs that admit p-planar storyplans. We prove that the problem
        of deciding whether a given graph admits a 1-planar storyplan is NP-hard
        and we present a parameterized algorithm attempt with respect to the
        vertex cover number. We conclude the thesis by stating the open problems
        in this ﬁeld. These ﬁndings not only enhance our understanding of graph
        representation through storyplans but also inspire further research.
