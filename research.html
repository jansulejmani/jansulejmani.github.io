        <h3>1-Planar Storyplans</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Abstract:</strong> The ﬁeld of dynamic graph visualization has
          received a lot of attention in recent years as new use cases for the
          exploration of complex graphs have emerged. For example, the
          representation of vast amounts of relational data as graphs have made
          a visual analysis more challenging. Storyplans have been introduced as
          a tool for representing such graphs in a sequential and understandable
          manner. While planar storyplans as well as outerplanar and forest
          storyplans have been studied, there has been no research that has gone
          into the direction of more powerful storyplans such as 1-planar
          storyplans. This thesis explores the construction of 1-planar
          storyplans and delves into the speciﬁc graph classes that admit these
          kinds of storyplans. We will extend the strict containment of graph
          classes that admit storyplans established by Fiala, Firman, Liotta,
          Wolff, and Zink (SOFSEM 2024) as we explore graphs that do admit
          1-planar storyplans but fail to do so for planar storyplans as well as
          graphs that do not admit 1-planar storyplans. Furthermore, we
          generalize this graph containment for the graphs that admit p-planar
          storyplans. We prove that the problem of deciding whether a given
          graph admits a 1-planar storyplan is NP-hard and we present a
          parameterized algorithm attempt with respect to the vertex cover
          number. We conclude the thesis by stating the open problems in this
          ﬁeld. These ﬁndings not only enhance our understanding of graph
          representation through storyplans but also inspire further research.
