      <h2>Routing Simulation</h2>
      <h3>
        A web application for routing simulation and visualization
      </h3>
      <p>October 2023 - February 2024</p>
      <p>This web application uses real-life traffic data stored on a PostgreSQL database to simulate trip duration, average speed, and traffic density. The user can enter a route by drawing a route on the map or by importing a GeoJSON file that contains a route of interest. A separate statistics overview page showcases and visualizes data about the trip. The web application was developed using JavaScript with the React framework in the frontend and Python with the Flask framework in the backend. Any data visualizations were done using the D3.js library.</p>
