        <h3>Automated parking system implemented in Verilog</h3>
        <p>
          This project includes the implementation of an elementary automated
          parking system in Verilog, writing a testbench for it, and simulating
          the system in the AMD Vivado Design Suite (formerly Xilinx Vivado).
          The state diagram was designed using Lucidcharts. The demo video
          captures the entire process of designing the state diagram,
          implementing the Verilog code for the system (and testbench) and
          inspecting the wave viewer in AMD Vivado.

        <h3>Routing simulation and visualization web application</h3>
        <p>
          This web application uses real-life traffic data stored on a
          PostgreSQL database to simulate trip duration, average speed, and
          traffic density. The user can enter a route by drawing a route on the
          map or by importing a GeoJSON file that contains a route of interest.
          A separate statistics overview page showcases and visualizes data
          about the trip. The web application was developed using JavaScript
          with the React framework in the frontend and Python with the Flask
          framework in the backend. Any data visualizations were done using the
          D3.js library.

        <h3>COLOR CASCADE! - A cross-platform casual mobile game</h3>
        <p>
          This is a casual mobile game where the objective is to beat the
          highscore by shooting sideways moving blocks of color with the
          correspondingly colored ball in time. It was developed using the C#
          programming language and the Unity game engine. The user interface and
          the game assets were designed using Figma.
